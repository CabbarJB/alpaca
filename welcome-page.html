            We bought it and in January of '05 moved in to the future home of "Alpacas All Around." The first order of
            business was to design the farm layout: how should the paddocks be oriented, what kind of shelter would we
            need,
            where should the shelter be sited, how would we move the alpacas from one paddock to the other with minimal
            effort? After dozens of drawings we came up with a plan that appeared to meet all of our needs—now finding
            someone to build it. That person was Lyndon Short. Lyndon is a master builder, familiar with farm systems
            for
            sheep and cattle, and very patient—perfect for two novice alpaca farmers.
